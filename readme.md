very much a work in progress. 

wrappers for base birst api calls in python3 and then build other useful functions on top of them

Starting with <birst_server>/CommandWebService.asmx?wsdl but will extend to include bacs.api as well.

Primarily building out to ease adminstration of spaces within our birst appliances, but will get to query excution within a space at some point too.

to comments and to tell me how to do things better: a@ley.io
